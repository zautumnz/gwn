# gwn

DEPRECATED, use Klaus

Like GitWeb, but Node

--------

## Installation

`npm i -g gwn`

## Usage

```shell
gwn -r path-to-repos-root -p port
# example
gwn -r ~/dev -p 8000
# root defaults to cwd
# port defaults to 9999
```

## Docker

`docker run -it -p 9999:9999 -v /path/to/repos:/repos gwn`

## Alternatives

* [GitWeb](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-GitWeb) — it's built
  in, but it's a CGI script written in Perl, which is not a language I love.
* [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/) — fast, but still quite complicated, and
  written in C, which is not very approachable.
* [Klaus](https://github.com/jonashaag/klaus) — simple, written in a good
  language (Python), well-maintained. If I didn't want to write my own, I'd be
  using this.

## TODO

* Refactor all the code, most of it is janky
* Branch and tag support
* Use something like [Isomorphic git](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git) or [Git-JS](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js) to do the actual git work, rather than execing all over the place
